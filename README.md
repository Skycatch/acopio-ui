Collection Center Management UI for Mexico earthquake response

This application is built with React and Mapbox GL, using the [create-react-app CLI](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#developing-components-in-isolation). The app must be mobile friendly at all times.

Per Codeando's design standards, the application uses the following fonts:
- Roboto Mono for titles (weights: 400)
- Roboto for everything else (weights: 400, 700)
